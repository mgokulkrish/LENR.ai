# Ideas
Methods:
	1. Fine Tuning.
	2. Distillation.


General Use-case finding.
1. Topic  Modelling and inject those data resources to LLMs to make the data set better.
2. Developing Recommendation System:  suggest papers based on abstract of the historical paper read by LERN.
3. Unique changes to Recommendation Systems: So it is able to find new collaborations, applications or suggest possible intersection with this domain.
4. Multi-Functionality  of LLMs as chatbot and recommendation systems.
5. Extrapolation pattern in data using LLMs. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01848.pdf), or possibility of pattern recognition in this domain ?
6. Document Classification - Already exists in Unsupervised Learning Domain at [LENR Dashboard](https://lenrdashboard.com/#). Can we use LLM for Topic Classification and Sub-classification which gives better accuracy? [Check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9dSt1cCW5k)
7. Translations - A lot of research requires collaboration with researchers from all across the globe. In this scenario, is there a requirement to translate research documents using LLMs from one language to another?
8. Summarization - Using LLMs to accurately summarize Reasearch Papers - [article](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/summarizing-and-querying-multiple-research-papers-with-langchain-fe0bf310926)
