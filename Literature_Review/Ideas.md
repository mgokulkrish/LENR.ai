# Ideas
Methods:
	1. Fine Tuning.
	2. Distillation.


General Use-case finding.
1. Topic  Modelling and inject those data resources to LLMs to make the data set better.
2. Developing Recommendation System:  suggest papers based on abstract of the historical paper read by LERN.
3. Unique changes to Recommendation Systems: So it is able to find new collaborations, applications or suggest possible intersection with this domain.
4. Multi-Functionality  of LLMs as chatbot and recommendation systems.
5. Extrapolation pattern in data using LLMs. [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01848.pdf), or possibility of pattern recognition in this domain ?
